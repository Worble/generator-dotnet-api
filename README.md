# I MADE THIS FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY

If you for some reason decide to use this, be aware that the majority of operations performed are NOT in memfs, and it does write DIRECTLY to the directory you're in. This means if anything goes wrong, you WILL need to clean up that directory before trying again.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-dotnet-webapi using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-dotnet-webapi
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo dotnet-webapi
```
